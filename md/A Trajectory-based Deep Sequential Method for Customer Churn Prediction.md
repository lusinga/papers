# A Trajectory-based Deep Sequential Method for Customer Churn Prediction

## ABSTRACT

Customer churn prediction is a pivotal issue in business marketing. Many researches have been pursuing more efficient features and techniques for it. Rapid growth of mobile Internet devices has generated large amounts of customer trajectory data, which contains abundant customer behavior patterns and contributes to many business actions. In this paper we propose a trajectory-based deep sequential method called TR-LSTM for customer churn prediction to mining the customer behavior pattern behind trajectory data. The method extracts three types of trajectory based features and applied the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to conduct sequential modeling. Experimental results on real-world customer trajectory data sets demonstrate that the proposed TR-LSTM obtains better performance than all baseline methods. Our method provides a new tool of churn prediction for both academics and practitioners.

客户流失预测是企业营销中的一个关键问题。许多研究一直在寻求更高效的特性和技术。移动互联网设备的快速增长产生了大量的客户轨迹数据，其中包含了丰富的客户行为模式，促成了许多商业行为。本文提出了一种基于轨迹的深度序列客户流失预测方法，即TR-LSTM，用于挖掘轨迹数据背后的客户行为模式。该方法提取三种基于轨迹的特征，应用长短期记忆神经网络(LSTM)进行序列建模。在真实客户轨迹数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的TR-LSTM方法比所有基线方法都具有更好的性能。我们的方法为学者和从业人员提供了一个新的人员流失预测工具。
