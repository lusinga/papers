# Dynamic Churn Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms - Predict your customer through customer behaviour

## Abstract

In current days, the customers are getting more attracted towards the quality of service (QoS) provided by the organizations. However, the current era is evidencing higher competition in providing technologically advanced QoS to the customers. Nevertheless, efficient customer relationship management systems can be advantageous for the organization for gaining more customers, maintaining customer relationships and improve customer retention by adding more profit to the organizational business. Furthermore, the machine learning models such as support vector machine algorithms can add more value to the customer retention strategies.

目前，客户越来越被组织提供的服务质量 (QoS) 所吸引。 然而，当前时代证明在向客户提供技术先进的 QoS 方面竞争更加激烈。 然而，有效的客户关系管理系统可以有利于组织获得更多客户、维护客户关系和通过为组织业务增加更多利润来提高客户保留率。 此外，支持向量机算法等机器学习模型可以为客户保留策略增加更多价值。

## VIII. CONCLUSION

Therefore, from the above discussion, it can be concluded that, regardless of the type of organization, every organization need to concern about the customer churn. Customer retention is the process of maintaining the loyalty of the customer by understanding the customer demand and serving them accordingly. Powerful churn prediction model will help the organizational management to predict the customer churn. Depending on the complex data of the telecommunication industry, support vector machine can turned out advantageous for predicting the churn rate. The above report has focused on the concept of customer retention along with the churn prediction. Apart from that, the use of support vector machine in order to enhance the churn prediction process has been discussed here along with the algorithm.

因此，从以上讨论可以得出结论，无论组织类型如何，每个组织都需要关注客户流失。 客户保留是通过了解客户需求并相应地为他们提供服务来维持客户忠诚度的过程。 强大的流失预测模型将帮助组织管理层预测客户流失。 根据电信行业的复杂数据，支持向量机在预测客户流失率方面具有优势。 上述报告重点关注客户保留和流失预测的概念。 除此之外，这里还讨论了使用支持向量机来增强流失预测过程以及算法。
