This article offers a comprehensive review of the research on Natural Language Generation (NLG) over the past two decades, especially in relation to data-to-text generation and text-to-text generation deep learning methods, as well as new applications of NLG technology. This survey aims to (a) give the latest synthesis of deep learning research on the NLG core tasks, as well as the architectures adopted in the field; (b) detail meticulously and comprehensively various NLG tasks and datasets, and draw attention to the challenges in NLG evaluation, focusing on different evaluation methods and their relationships; (c) highlight some future emphasis and relatively recent research issues that arise due to the increasing synergy between NLG and other artificial intelligence areas, such as computer vision, text, and computational creativity.

这篇文章对过去二十年的自然语言生成（NLG）研究进行了全面的回顾，特别是关于数据到文本生成和文本到文本生成的深度学习方法，以及NLG技术的新应用。这项调查旨在（a）给出深度学习在NLG核心任务上的最新综合，以及该领域采用的架构；（b）详细而全面地介绍各种NLG任务和数据集，并引起对NLG评估中的挑战的关注，重点介绍不同的评估方法及其关系；（c）强调一些未来的重点和相对较新的研究问题，这些问题是由于NLG与其他人工智能领域（如计算机视觉、文本和计算创造力）之间日益增强的协同作用而产生的。

## 1 INTRODUCTION

This article surveys the current state-of-the-art in Natural Language Generation (NLG), defined as the task of generating text from underlying non-linguistic representation of information [102]. NLG has been receiving more and more attention from researchers because of its extremely challenging and promising application prospects.
